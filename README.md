# TFLite Micro Cat vs Dog Classifier (MCXN947 Example)

README generated by ChatGPT

This is a working example of training and deploying a tiny machine learning model that classifies images as either **cat** or **dog**, built for microcontroller deployment on the **NXP MCXN947** running **FreeRTOS**.

It uses **knowledge distillation** to train a small student model to mimic a larger, more accurate teacher model, resulting in a classifier that is compact enough to run on constrained devices.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

- **Goal**: Classify image as `cat` or `dog`
- **Technique**: Trained using **knowledge distillation** to compress a larger model
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow / TensorFlow Lite Micro
- **Output**: Single logit (0 = Cat, 1 = Dog)

Training occurs in **Google Colab**, and the final TFLite model is compiled into firmware for inference.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samjkent/MCXN947-FreeRTOS.git
cd MCXN947-FreeRTOS
```

### 2. Build and flash to the MCXN947

Build and flash are handled via [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just):

```bash
just build     # Build firmware
just flash     # Flash firmware to device
```

All command details are found in the [`justfile`](./justfile).

## ðŸ“Ÿ Inference Output

Serial output from the device:

```
